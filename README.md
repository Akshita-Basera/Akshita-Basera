# Hi, I’m Akshita 👋

I’m a software engineer who loves building **high-performance systems** and **developer tools**—especially where **C++ + automation + AI** meet. I work across backend, tooling, and product thinking, and I enjoy turning messy real-world problems into clean, scalable solutions.

- 🧠 I build in **C++ / Python / TCL**, and I’m comfortable owning systems end-to-end  
- ⚡ I care a lot about **performance**, **robustness**, and **practical engineering**
- 🧩 I enjoy ** problem solving**, automation, and data-driven debugging  
- 🌍 I’m based in **India** and I’m interested in working with **global teams / international clients**
- 🧪 I’m currently **trying practical projects** to sharpen skills and ship real outcomes

---

## What I’m working on

- 🧪 **AI agents (from scratch)** — learning planning, memory, retrieval, tool-use, and evaluation  
- 🛠️ **Automation & productivity tools** — scripts and micro-tools that reduce manual work  
- 🚀 Building practical, production-style projects that showcase strong engineering: performance, reliability, clean architecture, and documentation  
- 🎥 Experimenting with AI-assisted video workflows to turn ideas into shareable projects (scripts → visuals → editing → publishing)

---

## About me (quick overview)

- 💼 I work on **backend development** and **tooling** (systems + automation mindset)  
- ⚙️ I like solving hard problems: **performance bottlenecks, debugging, reliability, clean architecture**  
- 🔍 I’m strong at **root-cause analysis**, writing maintainable code, and making systems observable  
- 🧠 I enjoy learning theory—but I focus on converting learning into **shippable projects**
- 🎭 Outside work: I’m into **reading**, **creative interests**-sketching/painting, storytelling, experimenting with visuals, and exploring new skills

---

## Tech I use

**Languages:** C++, Python, TCL, Bash  
**Areas:** Backend systems, automation, performance engineering, developer tooling  
**Tools:** Linux, Git, CI/testing workflows, log analysis

---

## Highlights

- ⚡ Performance-first engineering mindset  
- 🧱 Built automation to speed up workflows and reduce manual debugging  
- 🧠 Comfortable owning ambiguous projects: from design → implementation → debugging → delivery  
- 🚀 Focused on “learning by shipping” through practical projects

---

## What I’m learning next

- 🤖 Agentic AI: tool-use patterns, evals, memory, retrieval, orchestration  
- 📊 Data-driven engineering: better dashboards, metrics, and automated triage  
- 🧱 Leveling up my product execution: planning, prioritization, shipping, and maintenance

---

## How I like to collaborate

I’m always up for:
- building developer tools that save time,
- performance + reliability projects,
- automation that removes pain from workflows,
- practical AI applications (not hype—real utility).
